### DevOps Enthusiast | Homelabber | Girl Dad | Lifelong Learner

I have a passion for solving problems with technology.

I like to play with ```cloud```, ```code``` and ```containerization```. I'm also a big fan of open-source.

I do this stuff for fun; the terminal is my idea of a video game.

I also love good coffee ☕. My espresso machine cost more 💸 than my computer.
