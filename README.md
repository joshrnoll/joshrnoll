#### Systems Engineer | Homelabber | Lifelong Learner

I have a passion for ***automation***, ***innovation*** and ***open source software***. 

I don't like to do anything manually more than once. If I can figure out how to make it happen with code, I will. 

I do this stuff for fun; the terminal is my idea of a video game.  

I also love good coffee ☕. My espresso machine cost more 💸 than my computer.

#### I work with: 

💻 Linux
☁️ Azure
🅰️ Ansible
🐚 PowerShell
🖥️ Windows Server
🐋 Docker
🐍 Python
