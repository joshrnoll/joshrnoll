### Systems Engineer | Homelabber | Lifelong Learner

I have a passion for solving problems with technology. 

I like to tinker with ```automation```, ```infrastructure-as-code``` and ```open source software```. 

I do this stuff for fun; the terminal is my idea of a video game.  

I also love good coffee ☕. My espresso machine cost more 💸 than my computer.

#### I work with: 

💻 Linux
☁️ Azure
🅰️ Ansible
🐚 PowerShell
🖥️ Windows Server
🐋 Docker
🐍 Python
