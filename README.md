### Girl Dad | DevOps Enthusiast | Homelabber | Lifelong Learner

My passion lies where complex problems and technology meet. I have an insatiable curiosity for software development, deployment, automation and all things open source.

I like to write `code`. I like to work on `infrastructure`. I daily drive `linux`. I run `kubernetes` clusters from my garage.

I do this stuff for fun; the terminal is my idea of a video game.

Tech isn't the only thing I nerd out on though... Ask me about my espresso machine ☕.

#### I work with:

☕ JavaScript
🐍 Python
💲 Bash
⚛️ React
📈 Postgres
📉 MongoDB
💻 Linux
🅰️ Ansible
🐋 Docker
🚢 Kubernetes
🤓 And anything else that peaks my interest!

#### I also have experience with:

☁️ Azure
🖥️ Windows Server
🐚 PowerShell
🖥️ VMWare ESXi/vSphere
☁️ Cisco networking
